// The middleware is responsible for:

// 1. Refreshing the Auth token (by calling supabase.auth.getUser).
// 2. Passing the refreshed Auth token to Server Components, so they don't attempt to refresh the same token themselves. This is accomplished with request.cookies.set.
// 3. Passing the refreshed Auth token to the browser, so it replaces the old token. This is accomplished with response.cookies.set.
